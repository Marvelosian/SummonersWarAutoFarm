Setting Up Accessibility Apps on macOS
As a security measure, macOS doesn’t normally let programs control the mouse or keyboard.
To make PyAutoGUI work on macOS, you must set the program running your Python script to
be an accessibility application. Without this step, your PyAutoGUI function calls will have no effect.

Whether you run your Python programs from Mu, IDLE, or the Terminal, have that application open.
Then open the System Preferences and go to the Accessibility tab. The currently open applications will
appear under the “Allow the apps below to control your computer” label. Check Mu, IDLE, Terminal,
or whichever app you use to run your Python scripts. You’ll be prompted to enter your password to
confirm these changes.
